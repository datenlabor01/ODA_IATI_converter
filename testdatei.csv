The slurry is turned into biogas in an anaerobic fermentation tank. After an initial treatment, the methane-rich biogas is fed into the OCM reactor and converted into valuable ethylene. The reactor outlet gas is subsequently separated to obtain pure ethylene as the main product.This is achieved in an innovative pressure swing adsorption process using a specialised zeolite as adsorbent.The sustainability of the developed production chain is determined using Life Cycle Analysis. - Energy technologies and energy efficiency",Scientific cooperation with other countries (not included in other areas),2017-04-01,2020-03-31,D02,23182.0

These aspects need to be integrated in a way so that subsequent users can interpret the model results for further use in their model components, e.g. for vulnerability and risk assessment. Modeling data therefor need to be prepared in standards conforming ways. In cooperation with the South American partners it is envisaged to develop business models based on the findings of RIESGOS. - Strengthening civil society/ crisis prevention and help with solving conflicts",Geo-processes of the continental and oceanic lithosphere,2017-11-01,2021-02-28,C01,74020.0

The guidelines consist of methodological and instrumental elements as well as procedural recommendations in order to improve the integration of risk information in planning processes. Disaster risks are primarily caused by those actors that are responsible for the land-use in hazard prone area (land-use planning) and emergency management representing the coping capacity in case of an extreme event. By addressing these actors, the effectiveness of the different RIESGOS modules can be enhanced. The guidelines will be developed in close cooperation with partners in South America. An applicability test of the guidelines will take place in Chile by means of a gaming simulation together with representatives of land-use planning and emergency management. - Strengthening civil society/ crisis prevention and help with solving conflicts",Geo-processes of the continental and oceanic lithosphere,2017-11-01,2021-02-28,C01,74020.0

Innovative dialogue procedures are conceived and carried out as examples in the pilot regions (Chile, Peru, Ecuador). A recommendation catalogue will be developed for the development of strategies of risk communication in complex and interacting risk situations.The results of the dialogue procedures provide indications for the need for and the prioritization of capacity development measures for local authorities, enterprises and / or civil society organizations. - Strengthening civil society/ crisis prevention and help with solving conflicts",Geo-processes of the continental and oceanic lithosphere,2017-11-01,2021-02-28,C01,74020.0

In the framework of a pilot implementation in Ghana at the site of the local partner Don Bosco, a sharing system for e-mopeds and cargo bikes will be tested technically and economically and adapted in consideration of local conditions and user requirements. Sustainable mobility needs to be planned in connection with renewable energy supply. Therefore, a smart mini-grid of solar systems and charging stations will be developed within the project. This mini-grid, unlike stand-alone systems, has sufficient power to supply the e-vehicles.Part of the mini-grid is an automated metering of the vehicles' electricity consumption and smart demand management through real-time adjustment of the electricity price to supply, demand, weather and battery status. The aim is to intensify the use of sustainable mobility alternatives and at the same time to contribute to the improved access to reliable and sustainable energy. As there is a considerable problem with electronic waste in Ghana, the final life cycle of the developed product system will be considered. Therefore, existing recycling structures in Ghana are analysed, and options for second life applications of solar modules and batteries are examined.

Thereby, joint on-site and professional expertise, as well as experience from the past project will be used. At the same time, the project aims to create a concept study for an integrated wastewater management concept (WWC), adapted to local conditions. To ensure long-term and sustainable implementation of the concept as well as compliance with environmental standards, accompanying measures in the areas of knowledge transfer and capacity building will be developed, including suggestions for suitable forms of environmental infrastructures management.Additionally, the concepts' implementation will be accompanied by the project team, including the application of German recycling, disposal, and water technology. All works (concept extension from WMC to CEC, implementation, concept study of WWC, accompanying actions) are developed in close collaboration with local stakeholders. The inter-communal cooperation is organized in the form of inter-communal purpose agreements.

Thereby, joint on-site and professional expertise, as well as experience from the past project will be used. At the same time, the project aims to create a concept study for an integrated wastewater management concept (WWC), adapted to local conditions. To ensure long-term and sustainable implementation of the concept as well as compliance with environmental standards, accompanying measures in the areas of knowledge transfer and capacity building will be developed, including suggestions for suitable forms of environmental infrastructures management.Additionally, the concepts' implementation will be accompanied by the project team, including the application of German recycling, disposal, and water technology. All works (concept extension from WMC to CEC, implementation, concept study of WWC, accompanying actions) are developed in close collaboration with local stakeholders.

The goal of the project is to conceptualize and pilot an economically viable, low-emission and resilient 'Garden Coffee' production system in the transition zone of the Biosphere reserve. This should reduce the deforestation pressure and simultaneously rehabilitate non-forest areas. Part of this is an examination of the feasibility, taking the capacity development of 2.000 small-scale coffee producers concerning improved cultivation and processing methods into account.

For this purpose, we will take advantage of natural variability within E. guineensis elite genitors to select appropriate trees, and we will also include wild palm trees. We will carry out genetic analyses to identify molecular markers for future marker-assisted selection. At last, we will perform an in depth study on the flexibility brought by low-lipase lines to define new harvesting practices compatible with those of smallholders, and leading to oil with lower free fatty acid levels. We expect that more stable crude oil with high levels of vitamins will prove an important asset to reduce vitamin A deficiency in Africa.

Children and young people are particularly affected by this. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) definition, this 'double burden of malnutrition' is characterized by 'the coexistence of undernutrition along with overweigt and obesity, or diet related non-communicable deseases, within individuals, households and populations, and across the life course'. Since developing countries are experiencing a transformation of their nutrition systems due to urbanization and industrialization, nutritionists and development economists assume that the double-burden problem will increase dramatically in the coming years. This will have far-reaching negative consequences for the health of poorer populations and their development opportunities. Moreover, the 'double burden' is a global problem that can also be observed among socio-economically disadvantaged groups in industrialised countries. The topic is directly related to the global sustainability goals (SDGs) of Agenda 2030, especially SDG 2 (overcoming all forms of malnutrition by 2030). Even though the urgency of the double-burden problem has now been recognised, there are still considerable gaps in knowledge with regard to its underlying causes and consequences. Moreover, there is an urgent need for a better understanding of the strategies that can be applied to effectively address the problem of double burdens.

The current Vietnamese national strategy to improve the competitiveness of Vietnam's coffee exports addresses the need to improve product quality. One proposed measure is to change the processing method of the coffee cherries from dry to wet processing. While wet-processing can make farmers and the whole value chain less dependent on weather conditions, produce higher quality coffee beans and potentially increase profits at each stage in the value chain, new challenges arise from the centralized production of large amounts of by-products in these plants. Water and energy consumption increase, and effective treatment processes for wet solids and wastewater are required. The purpose of the proposed project is to develop new innovative solutions to valorize by-products in the coffee processing sector. The project will explore, first theoretically and then experimentally, the use of an emerging thermochemical conversion process, hydrothermal carbonization (HTC), to convert wet solid by-products at temperatures of 180-250 degree Celsius to carbon-rich materials (hydrochars) within a relatively short time (minutes to hours). The hydrochars can be combusted to generate heat and power. Since little to no knowledge on the conversion with HTC of solid and liquid by-products from coffee berries exists, a central outcome of the proposed research will be evidence for the technical feasibility of integrating HTC in the wet-processing plant and its waste treatment facilities. The project will develop and assess alternative designs for process combinations based on these results, evaluating their impact on resource use and environmental emissions in coffee processing. In addition, the project will strengthen the scientific cooperation between Viet Nam and Germany by developing a collaboration framework for further research with the goal to implement innovative solutions to improve the sustainability in the coffee value chain.",Valorization of by-products from wet coffee processing - waste to carbon-rich material to improve the sustainability of the coffee value chain,2019-09-01,2023-09-30,D02,32173.0

The production of pineapples is particularly challenging in this respect. The Philippines is the world's third largest producer of pineapples, producing more than 2.6 million metric tons. As a by-product of pineapple production, pineapple residues (PR, ~ 90 to 150 t ha-1) form an important biological resource. Despite of this, PR are commonly left at the edge of the field to rot or dried and burned, a conventional practice at especially small farms (< 2 ha) since it is costly and laborious to further utilize these residues for e.g., bioethanol, bromelain or biochar production.Reuse PR in terms of mulching and/or incorporation to replace mineral fertilizer however, might help to cope with all of the above mentioned challenges.Unfortunately, to date there is no clear evidence for that. Hence, the aim of this PhD-project is to demonstrate that returning PR (with or without secondary recycling due to prior extraction of valuable constituents) to the field is in principle suitable to maintain soil fertility, reduce the climate impact, secure yield stability and achieve high resource efficiency. Therefore, a combination of field and laboratory experiments as well as balances approaches will be applied. The main project aims are - (I) to investigate whether PR reuse in terms of mulching/incorporation minimizes GHG and gaseous C/N losses, increases C sequestration and improves the nutrient-cycling (C/N/P/K) (II) to determine how secondary recycling of certain PR components affects GHG emissions and nutrient-cycling (C/N/P/K)The project aims will be accomplished by combining field GHG measurements (UPLB) with incubation/greenhouse studies at ZALF.",Reuse of pineapple residues at small farms to improve nutrient-cycling and income stability as well as to reduce agricultural GHG emissions,2020-02-01,2023-08-15,D02,31182.0

The aim is to change the food environment on the policy, community and interpersonal levels such that a sufficient and well-balanced diet is achievable, simple to attain and attractive for all. The geographic focus is Sub-Sahara Africa with South Africa at the core. Existing approaches to improve nutrition mostly target one form of malnutrition exclusively. However, in many low- and middle-income countries the different forms of malnutrition and related diseases co-exist and interact. For example, undernutrition during childhood can increase the risk for overnutrition and obesity among adults. The term 'double burden of malnutrition' has been coined for this phenomenon. Internationally, it is increasingly recognized that the various forms of malnutrition need to be examined and addressed synergistically to meet these challenges. Within this project, existing methodological approaches will be build to improve food environments on the policy-, community- and interpersonal in a comprehensive approach to address malnutrition in all its forms. In doing so, specific conditions will be considered that are typical of countries of the Global South, such as the presence of a formal and informal sector. Subsequently, these approaches will be piloted and evaluated in South Africa. Furthermore, existing regional networks will be expanded to support and foster food system research and evidence-based policy action for improving food environments in Sub-Sahara Africa.",Food environments in Africa: Addressing Malnutrition using a Syndemics Approach,2021-11-01,2024-11-30,D02,43073.0

This global system is managed by the Animal Production and Health Division (AGA). It provides National Coordinators for the Management of AnGR (NC) nominated by countries with a secure means to control the entry, updating and accessing of their national data. Throughout the existence of DAD-IS, population data have been lacking for many breeds. This information is critical for guiding the national management of AnGR and the calculation of SDG Indicator 2.5.2 (SDG = Sustainable Development Goals, SDG 2.5.2 = Proportion of local breeds classified as being at risk, not-at-risk or at unknown level of risk of extinction), for which AGA is the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) focal point. As of March 2018, across the world, when excluding extinct breeds, 67 percent of local breeds are classified as of unknown risk status, 26 percent as at risk, and 7 percent as not at risk of extinction. The main reason for the data gap is lack of population data on country level. Livestock censuses, if carried out at all, are expensive and thus not sufficiently frequent relative to the annual SDG reporting. Moreover, they usually do not provide information on breed level. Therefore, countries need cost efficient solutions allowing them to estimate regularly the population sizes of their AnGR.
